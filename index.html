            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I always have been eager and enthusiastic when it comes to web development. I have also worked on a project called "Kruskal's Algorithm Visualizer" wherein I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was first introduced to web development when I was 13 years old and I found it magical at that time.</p>

            <img class="PS Skills" src="Pictures/algorithm.gif" alt="">
            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>I have been practising and working on my Data Structures and Algorithm skill-set from past one year but I belive there is still a long way to go, whenever I get some free time I usually open Codechef or Hackerrank and start to practice there more and more so that I can get a good hold over the problem solving.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="skill-row S2">
            <img class="PR Skills" src="Pictures/coding.png" alt="">
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I can work in multiple programming languages such as Python, C and Java however I am most comfortable with Java because I was introduced to Java when I was in class 9 there first I just found it a little boring but as we progressed coding starts to facinate me</p>
          </div>

            <img class="CS Skills" src="Pictures/cyber.gif" alt="">
            <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
            <p>I am a begineer in this but I have learnt various cyber security tools. Learinng cyber security is fun and at the same time it provides us with the knowledge which could be used to protect atleast us if not the entire community as with the advancement of technology, Cyber Crimes are at its peak hence it is important to have a little knowledge regarding the same</p>

            <img class="CC Skills" src="Pictures/AWS.gif" alt="">
            <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>I have also started to learn AWS and Cloud Computing. I was facinated when I started to read what cloud computing is and the defination itself defines how unique and futuristic cloud computing is.</p>
